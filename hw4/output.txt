defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and to civil assembly .

" so , make a reduction , the majority of our projects кораблестроению and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine confidence of those who support our army and will seriously preparedness . "
" although the military funding foreign emergency operations not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff staff would be reduced , leading to опозданиям with military suppliers , and legal and political support be broken . "
" the sequestration in the ministry of defense would be fast decline in the united states as a leading global military power . "
" this is not an option , which we may live and this is not an option , that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or the last warning senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for the pentagon from cuts , will see later on .
at a press conference last week secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what could be next -- troops from the shell , but without the core .
" it is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in introductory remarks at the pentagon .

story of fraud on the tests in schools and college is the norm .
coaches , to teach the opposite , they send a message that lies and fraud are .
for one day , according to study , you can lie 10 to 200 times .

in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim " caught ! " , lies is a serious of knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
should not from the draw the conclusion that liars to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and help in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men are more lie about yourself , whereas women -- about the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lie to our partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch asphyxia , laughed , voice of your property .
rats can secure the top of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , change its position in a certain way , or to show " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can use the disengagement in a speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat the question entirely .
someone can use the language " , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... i know . . . as far as i know . "
there is no magic means to identify , but the skill can detect deception .

germany , in turn , growth at 0.5 % for the period .
if there is , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotion , it is energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that the election meetings are for reflection about share and place their nuclear energy .
france needs build his opinion on objective facts and sound .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources to continue electricity production time , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalance - theme that disappeared from the environmental debate .
why germany only one in his decision to stop its nuclear energy .
on the other hand , the uk , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , just few of those who strongly to their projects .
while the model , based on renewable energy , sometimes as an example , the reality contradicts this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which it gets 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого wind ; because of the carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy the price of energy is key to competitiveness and the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefit from cheap electricity in europe .
the price , the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not object to the type of energy in general .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a of specialized in international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and create many jobs that could not be moved to another industry .
any engineer electrician will order erp , to work sixty years , if the planned closure of its producer ?
development of areva - to low - carbon , nuclear and renewable energy sources , shows that взаимодополнимости .
in france we have the security , which monitors energy centers , too , and transparent , such as фламанвиль .
in 50 years , nuclear industry had three of the incident .
in chernobyl reactor and unforgivable mistake led to the tragedy .
nuclear industry will lessons from the crash , learned of the two .
as it is all the specialists in the field of energy to build a reactor , stop its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь to leadership in imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when interior minister ( либерасьон " on may 23 ) , said that france " does not need foreign talent , masons and waiters . "
both sides as the immigration burdens to the french economy and french society .
in his programme francois hollande was spouting platitudes , saying that " working together would solve our immigration . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей last details of immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that are immigrants .
fears of the immigrants based on the view that they can replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking falling wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the skilled - dynamic sectors , where training not related to the proposals .
just as surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants , leads to the arrival of immigrants that positively affects the wages of workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates is of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the organization work , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years for his life will bring the budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) , an average of 150,000 euros .
the teeth , used to scare immigrants , gave just the opposite effect .

no , we are dreaming not edge the guillotine , but the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - on and democracy , this time on a european level .
europe completely to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer europe , but the entire europe gradually lost its sovereignty , and with it each of its nations .
because only europeans to work can reduce the severity of debt each , from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it .
after a long discussion of this proposal the and jacques delors all now require the european economic government .
but to her without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in граздан , is another madness and new .
to install the in france , was to " create a " republican .
this could only be done by a more democratic europe on the political level , this european sovereignty .
